# SlideShare Presentation Downloader

A Node.js-based tool for downloading educational content from SlideShare presentations for offline study purposes. 

## üéØ Purpose

This tool was developed to help students download educational content for offline study and research purposes. It's particularly useful for:
- Downloading presentations for offline access
- Creating local backups of educational materials
- Enabling study in areas with limited internet connectivity

## üöÄ Features

- Downloads high-resolution slides from SlideShare presentations
- Automatically handles slide navigation
- Saves slides in sequential order
- Maintains original image quality
- Creates a JSON file with all slide URLs
- Supports error handling and logging

## üìã Prerequisites

Before running this tool, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/slideshare-downloader.git
cd slideshare-downloader
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## üîç Identifying Correct Selectors

Before using the script, you need to verify and potentially update the CSS selectors as they might change over time. Here's how to find the correct selectors:

1. Open your target SlideShare presentation
2. Right-click on any slide and select "Inspect Element" (or press F12)
3. Look for the HTML structure of the slides. In the current version, it follows this pattern:
   ```html
   <div id="slide1" class="VerticalSlide_root__jU_9r slide-item">
     <div class="VerticalSlideImage_root__64KSA">
       <img id="slide-image-0" ...>
   ```

4. You need to update three key selectors in the script:
   - The main slide container class (currently `VerticalSlide_root__jU_9r`)
   - The image container class (currently `VerticalSlideImage_root__64KSA`)
   - The image ID pattern (currently `slide-image-X` where X is the slide number)

5. To update these in the script:
   ```javascript
   // Update this selector
   await page.waitForSelector('.VerticalSlide_root__jU_9r', { 
       timeout: 60000 
   });

   // Update this selector in the evaluate function
   const img = document.querySelector(`#slide-image-${currentSlide}`);
   ```

### üîç How to Find Your Selectors:

1. **Finding Container Classes**:
   - Look for a repeating pattern of divs that contain each slide
   - The classes might be different but will follow a similar structure
   - They often have randomized suffixes (like `__jU_9r`) which may change

2. **Finding Image IDs**:
   - Look for the `<img>` tags within the slide containers
   - Note how their IDs increment (e.g., `slide-image-0`, `slide-image-1`)

3. **Testing Your Selectors**:
   - In the browser console, you can test selectors:
   ```javascript
   document.querySelector('.YourNewClassName')
   document.querySelector('#slide-image-0')
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

1. Open `index.js`
2. Update the selectors as identified above
3. Modify the `slideshareUrl` variable with your target presentation URL
4. Adjust the `totalSlides` variable to match your presentation's length

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

1. Run the script:
```bash
node index.js
```

2. The script will:
   - Create a `slides_hq` directory for downloaded images
   - Download all slides sequentially
   - Create a `slide_urls_hq.json` file with all image URLs

## üìù Output

- Images are saved in the `slides_hq` directory
- Files are named sequentially (e.g., `slide_001.jpg`, `slide_002.jpg`)
- A JSON file (`slide_urls_hq.json`) contains all slide URLs

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Educational Use Only**: This tool is intended for educational purposes only
2. **Rate Limiting**: The script includes delays to prevent overwhelming the server
3. **Error Handling**: Failed downloads are logged but don't stop the process
4. **Browser Window**: The script runs in non-headless mode for better stability

## üîß Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Script stops unexpectedly**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify the total number of slides
   - Increase timeout values if necessary
   - **Verify class names and selectors** are correct for your version of SlideShare

2. **Images not downloading**
   - Verify the presentation URL is accessible
   - Check folder permissions
   - Ensure sufficient disk space
   - **Double-check the image selectors** in the browser inspector

3. **Selector Errors**
   - If you get errors about elements not being found, the class names might have changed
   - Follow the "Identifying Correct Selectors" section to update them
   - Test new selectors in the browser console before updating the script
